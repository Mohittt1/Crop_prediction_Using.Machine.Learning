Dissertation Viva-Voce examination of Agriculture holds immense
importance in India as a widely practiced occupation and plays a crucial role in the country's
development. With approximately 60 percent of the total land dedicated to agriculture, India meets
the needs of its 1.2 billion population through this sector. Enhancing crop production is considered
a significant aspect of agriculture. To effectively utilize a piece of land, it is essential to determine
the suitable crops based on the specific area and its corresponding soil properties. Various factors,
such as soil type, temperature, and humidity, influence crop cultivation. However, the agricultural
sector faces challenges due to unnatural climate changes, leading to decreased food production and
making it difficult for farmers to forecast future yields. Providing farmers with advance knowledge
of suitable crops before sowing could greatly benefit them and enable informed decisions
regarding storage and business operations.
To address these issues, our proposed project focuses on monitoring agricultural areas based on
soil properties and recommending the most appropriate crops to farmers. This recommendation
system utilizes machine learning techniques such as unsupervised learning, predictive modeling,
K-Means clustering, and Logistic Regression. By considering input soil parameters, including
temperature, humidity, and moisture content, the system suggests suitable crops. We collect
relevant data on crop seeds, ensuring optimal conditions for successful growth. The
implementation of this system aims to minimize financial losses incurred by farmers from planting
unsuitable crops and enables them to explore new types of crops suitable for their specific regions.
